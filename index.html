                My name is Domonic Yang. I was born on June 13, 2005 in Maplewood, Minnesota and lived there for three years before moving to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. I have lived in Wisconsin until I was seventeen before moving to Hawaii. I currently live in Aiea, Hawaii. I plan on going to the University of MƒÅnoa, currently an undecided major but I am thinking of an engineering career.
